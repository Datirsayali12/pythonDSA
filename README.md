# Basic Python Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to the Basic Python Data Structures and Algorithms repository! This repository contains a collection of basic Python DSA questions along with implementations of data structures such as tuples, dictionaries, lists, stacks, queues, and linked lists. Each question or implementation is provided as a Jupyter notebook program along with documentation to help you understand and learn these concepts.

## Data Structures and Algorithms Included

1. **Tuples, Dictionaries, and Lists:**
   - Description: Basic questions and exercises related to tuples, dictionaries, and lists.
   - File: `tuples_dicts_lists.ipynb`

2. **Stack Implementation:**
   - Description: Implementation of a stack data structure in Python.
   - File: `stack_implementation.ipynb`

3. **Queue Implementation:**
   - Description: Implementation of a queue data structure in Python.
   - File: `queue_implementation.ipynb`

4. **Linked List Implementation:**
   - Description: Implementation of a singly linked list data structure in Python.
   - File: `linked_list_implementation.ipynb`

## Getting Started

To get started with these data structures and algorithms, simply clone the repository to your local machine:
